        I am also proud of my achievements, such as winning Code-Quest 1.0 with a room booking app and securing 3rd place in Code-Quest 2.0 for the Petty Cash Book Management System. As an active member of various clubs like E-Cell, GDSC-Iare, and e-DAM, I continue to enhance my skills in both leadership and collaboration.

        With proficiency in technologies like Node.js, React.js, Python, and more, I enjoy building responsive, user-friendly web applications. Iâ€™m constantly driven by a commitment to learning, problem-solving, and delivering high-quality solutions.
